    <p>Postcard + Stamp</p>
    <p>A travel postcard denouncing the poaching of elephants.</p>
    <p>2022, Programs used: Illustrator</p>
    <p>My postcard and stamp were the final result of a multi step project. I had to choose an animal and create abstracted versions of it.
      I chose the elephant as my animal for this project because it's one of my favorite animals. 
      I thought the idea of centering my postcard around poaching would be important because it's one of the reasons why their population is decreasing.
      After doing some research, I found out about Ivory Orphans.</p>
    <p>Ivory Orphans (or African Wildlife Trust) is a Tanzanian based elephant orphanage that rescues, rehibilitates, and reintegrates elephant calves who have become orphans because of poachers or human element conflicts.
      They are Tanzania's first and only elephant orphanage.
      Before Ivory Orphans, there had been "no facility in Tanzania equipped to rescue" the dying elephants.
      And even though rescue efforts are expensive, Ivory Orphans CEO Pratik Patel says "the cost of saving one baby elephant is worth every cent that is spent on recovery and reintroduction efforts." </p>

    <p>Hawaii Travel Poster + Ad</p>
    <p>A travel poster and ad promoting tourism for Hawaii, inspired by U-Haul graphics.</p>
    <p>2022, Programs used: Illustrator</p>
    <p>For this project, I had to pick a U.S. state and create a poster along with an ad for it.
      I chose Hawaii because of its culture and beaches.
      The poster focuses mainly on the cultural and natural aspect of Hawaii while the ad focuses on the beach and people.</p>
    <p>For my poster, I wanted to include the different elements of Hawaii. I curved the name of the state to mimic the curvature of the islands and added a lei to it.
      I remember seeing in the Even Stevens movie that the staff gives you a lei when you arrive at the airport and I thought it would be nice to include that in the poster.
      The background is made up of the Mokolai coastline. In the middle of the poster is Diamond Head (left) and the volcano KÄ«lauea right beside it.
    <p>When I hear Hawaii, I immediately think of the different aspects of Polynesian culture that make the island what it is. 
      That's why I added the hula girl and fire knife dancers. In fact, I actually built the poster based around the hula girl.
      When I first saw the picture, I knew I wanted to include it in my poster as the focal point.
      I feel like it just grabs your attention and pulls you into the poster.</p>
    <p>My Hawaii ad focuses more-so on people and relaxation rather than culture like my poster. 
      I wanted to establsih a welcoming feeling to the ad by incorporating people interacting on the beach.</p>

    <p>King Tut Historical Figure Project</p>
    <p>A stationary set (letterhead, envelope, and business card) made for a famous figure in history.
      Includes museum ticket (additional item).</p>
    <p>2022, Programs used: Illustrator</p>
    <p>This stationary set was created as a proposed design for a famous figure in history. 
      I chose King Tut because, like many other people, I've always heard and read about him, so I thought it would be cool to design a stationary set for him.
      Since his casket is gold, I figured teal would be a perfect color that could compliment the color.
      For my logo, I drew the side profile of King Tut to mimic hieroglypics since the people are always drawn sideways.
      I also wanted to incorporate hieroglyphics into this project, i.e. the stamp.
      The stamp that I included on the the letterhead and the backs of the envelope and business card is King Tut's name.</p>

      <p>A title sequence for the movie "In The Mood For Love" by Wong Kar-Wai.</p>
      <p>2023, Programs used: After Effects</p>
      <p>In my title sequence I wanted a vintage video showcasing Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan's "relationship" within the movie.
        With the film being set in 1962 Hong Kong, I decided to add a vintage effect to my video in After Effects.
        The videos show pieces of Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow's "relationship" in no specific order.
        The opening scene is a transition that I thought went well in introducing the characters.
        The hand scene shows their progression. </p>
        <p>I also wanted to play with the placement of the words. ...</p>
